# The Code Breaker Challenge
See [this link](https://github.com/Ryamonster10/advcode/blob/main/README.md) after you have read through this for instructions on how to setup your coding environment.
## Task Overview
Create a program that simulates the process of breaking into a digital vault by solving a series of randomly generated codes.

## Core Requirements

### Code Generation
- The program should generate a random code. The structure of this code can vary. Examples include a numeric sequence, a string of characters, a pattern of symbols, etc.

### Decryption Logic
- Implement a decryption algorithm. This could be pattern recognition, mathematical computations, string manipulations, etc. The complexity and nature of the algorithm are up to you.

### User Interaction
- The user should play a role in the decryption process. This could involve guessing elements of the code, providing inputs to guide the algorithm, solving mini-puzzles, etc.

### Feedback System
- After each user interaction, provide feedback that helps them understand how close they are to solving the code. Be creative with the feedback mechanism.

### Winning Condition
- Define a clear winning condition when the code is successfully broken.

### Variability
- Ensure each run of the program generates a different code, requiring a new decryption strategy.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Creativity in Code and Decryption:** There are many different ways to approach this challenge. Do something nobody else would.
- **User Engagement:** The interaction should be engaging and require some thought or strategy.
- **Robustness:** Handle edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully.
- **Documentation:** Comment the code well to explain the thought process and logic. In addition, write a description in the README.md file.

## Optional Challenges

- **Difficulty Levels:** Allow users to select different difficulty levels, which changes the complexity of the code.
- **Time Tracking:** Implement a timer and score system based on how quickly the code is broken.
- **Multi-Stage Decryption:** Create a multi-layered code that requires solving multiple smaller puzzles or codes to unlock the final vault.
